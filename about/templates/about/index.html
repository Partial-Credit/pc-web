			When the lights go out and all hope is lost in the city of Troy,<br> 
			Partial Credit - RPI's only teal-clad a cappella group - is there.
			<br><br>Since 2003, Partial Credit has been bm bopping and zun zowing across the Northeast, saving
			lost souls with the power of music. In addition to performing on and off campus throughout the
			year, PC regularly competes in the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella, recently
			placing 4th in their 2016 Quarterfinal and winning Best Arrangement for the second year in
			a row. They also host their own show each semester! <br><br>
			The group is fresh off the release of their newest CD, Simple Harmonic Motion, with
			ambitious plans in the near future.
